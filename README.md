# Centralized Healthcare Information System
In this project, we engineer and implement a Centralized Healthcare Information System portal, giving instant access to critical patient data and improving patient care during medical crises 
Integrating a secure communication interface within CHIS, facilitating seamless and personalized interactions between patients and healthcare providers

The entire database implementation was carried out using MySQL, ensuring robustness and reliability. Additionally, a partial prototype was developed on the MongoDB platform to explore the feasibility of this system in a NoSQL environment. There is also an integration of the MySQL database with Python.

## Features
- **Centralized Patient Database:** Access comprehensive patient histories and critical health information from a single platform.
- **Secure Communication:** Enables encrypted interactions between patients and healthcare professionals.
- **Data Integration:** Integrates with existing healthcare systems to provide a cohesive view of patient data.
- **Real-time Updates:** Ensures that all patient data is up-to-date, providing healthcare professionals with the latest information.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL:** For robust database management.
- **MongoDB:** Used in prototype development to explore NoSQL database advantages.
- **Python:** For scripting and automation of database interactions.

## Installation
Instructions for setting up the CHIS locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Centralized_Healthcare_Information_system.git
